                    "If you don't preach pure, unadulterated grace,
                    people's lives will never be floriously blessed and gloriously transformed"

            <p>
                    This one statement that God made to Joseph Prince in 1997 completely transformed the way Joseph preached and taught the gospel.

And thus began the Grace Revolution.

Joseph had been holidaying with his wife Wendy in the Swiss Alps and there, amid the majestic landscape, God told him that he had not been preaching grace, and gave him the mandate to preach grace—pure and unadulterated. This meant preaching about God’s grace without attempting to balance, or mix, it with the law. Desiring to see his congregation liberated, empowered and blessed by the Lord, Joseph fully embraced the mandate from God and has not looked back since.

            <h2>Unveiling Jesus and his finished work</h2>
            <p>
                    Since then, God has more than validated His word, not just in the explosive growth of Joseph’s local congregation in Singapore, but also wherever the gospel of grace has been preached. The church Joseph pastors numbered some 2,000 members in 1997, and this has grown to more than 31,000 members today.

To date, Joseph has spoken in Israel, Norway, Holland, the UK, the US, Canada, Australia, and Asia, impacting not only believers, but also church leaders with practical and revelatory preaching that unveils the person and grace of Jesus Christ.
